## Peer Evaluation: Info301 Week7 Presentation**

### 1. Overall Comments  
- **Strengths Observed:**  
  - The presentation effectively incorporates advanced visualization techniques like SHAP feature interaction heatmaps and interactive causal graphs, showcasing a strong understanding of technical tools.  
  - The project addresses a complex topic with clear intent and provides actionable insights using innovative methods, which enhances its relevance and impact.  

- **Acknowledgments:**  
  - The use of SHAP dashboards and dynamic topic tracking reflects a creative approach to exploring data relationships and trends.  
  - The inclusion of interactive elements adds an engaging dimension to the analysis, making the results more accessible and user-friendly.

### 2. Suggestions for Major Revision  
- **Area for Improvement:**  
  - The visualizations, while technically impressive, may appear overly complex to viewers unfamiliar with SHAP or causal graphs. It is unclear how these visualizations connect to the overall narrative of the research.  
  - The presentation lacks sufficient context or explanation for how the figures (e.g., the SHAP heatmap) contribute to answering the research question or achieving the objectives.  

- **Actionable Suggestions:**  
  - Simplify the visualizations by focusing on key insights and providing annotations or step-by-step explanations to guide the audience through the figures.  
  - Add concise, descriptive captions for each figure to explain their purpose, methodology, and relevance to the overarching research goals. This would help the audience understand how each visualization contributes to the broader narrative.

### 3. Suggestions for Minor Revision  
- **Enhancement Identified:**  
  - The interactive features are compelling but may be challenging to interpret in a static presentation format. For example, the time-series SHAP dashboard and interactive causal graph would benefit from additional explanations or multiple snapshots.  
  - Some visualizations, such as the dynamic topic tracking scatter plot, seem dense and could be simplified or presented in segments to highlight specific insights.  

- **Recommendations:**  
  - Include static snapshots or alternative representations of the interactive features, focusing on key takeaways from the data.  
  - Provide a brief legend or key for each visualization to make them more accessible to viewers with varying levels of technical expertise.  
  - Adjust font sizes and spacing to improve readability, particularly for figures with dense content or overlapping elements.

### 4. Vision for Advanced Integration  
- **Tool or Methodology:**  
  - Consider integrating predictive modeling or causal inference techniques to add depth to the analysis, demonstrating not just relationships but potential outcomes or interventions.  
  - Explore the use of machine learning explainability tools like LIME or other dashboards alongside SHAP to offer complementary perspectives.  

- **Interdisciplinary Integration:**  
  - Collaborate with domain experts (e.g., statisticians, data scientists, or subject-matter experts in the field of study) to refine the interpretation of the visualizations and ensure they align with real-world applications.  
  - Include a discussion of how the insights gained from these advanced techniques could inform practical decisions or policies, tying the results to broader societal or organizational impacts.
